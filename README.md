# Act Viewer

It is going to be a simple project for an Object-Oriented Programming course at my university that I am enrolled on. The main purpose of this program is to parse an act (documment), find the accurate part of it and print it or just write down its table of contents.

#### Options

```sh
main <options> [arguments]

    -h             show help
    -f <file>      documment to view
    -c <chapter>   show content from chosen chapter
    -a <article>   show content from chosen article
    -s <section>   show content from chosen section
    -p <point>     show content from chosen point
    -l <line>      show content from chosen line
    -u <unit>      show content from chosen unit
    -t <table>     show table of contents

```
